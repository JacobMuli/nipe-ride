                <h4>Why is the website loading slowly?</h4>
                <p>There are several reasons why a website may load slowly, including server issues, large image sizes, excessive JavaScript, and slow internet connections. To improve loading times, you can try clearing your browser cache, checking your internet speed, and ensuring that no other applications are using up bandwidth.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="general2">
                <h4>Why can't I access the website?</h4>
                <p>If you're unable to access the website, it could be due to server downtime, incorrect URL, or network issues. You can check if the website is down using services like DownDetector, verify the URL, or try accessing the site from a different network or device.</p>
